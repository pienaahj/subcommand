# subcommand
Modern command-line applications often implement “sub-commands” to bundle a suite of tools under a single command. The most well-known tool that uses this pattern is git. When examining a command like git init, git is the command and init is the sub-command of git. One notable feature of sub-commands is that each sub-command can have its own collection of flags.  Go applications can support sub-commands with their own set of flags using the flag.(*FlagSet) type. To illustrate this, create a program that implements a command using two sub-commands with different flags.
